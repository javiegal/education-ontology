# education-ontology

## Description
Ontology network in the education domain developed for the Intelligent Systems course of the Master's Programme in Data Science of UPM.

This repository contains all the work done for the Intelligent Systems assignment described in the [assignment guide](./docs/assignment_guide.pdf). It has two different parts:

- Part I: Five n-ary relation patterns modeled. OWL/XML files and diagrams for these patterns can be found in [`patterns`](./patterns) folder.
- Part II: Ontology for describing educational materials (slides, books, notes, videos, etc.) as well as other educational elements (courses, subjects, teachers, students, etc.) developed. This ontology reuses as much as existing ontologies (Schema, DBpedia, BIBO, and wgs84_pos) as was possible. This ontology is placed under the [`ontology`](./ontology) folder in an OWL/XML file and was developed using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

Finally, the [`docs`](./docs) folder contains a [report](./docs/report.pdf) that summarizes al the work done.
